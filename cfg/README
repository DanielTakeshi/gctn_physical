# Calibration files

I am using `panda_EE` as the hand joint, since that should coincide (hopefully)
with the pose from `fa.get_pose()` in frankapy.

I collected v04 on 02/05/2023. I think it's OK, though the z-offset seems a bit
smaller than I'd expect. I collected those with the default Franka Desk App
values, so the "x offset" there is -0.01 (not -0.05 as I later set it for
experiments). I'm not sure if that affects things? The "v03" here is also from
that day, but has that offset, and the resulting x-transformation seems off by
about 3-4cm.
