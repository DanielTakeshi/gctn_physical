# Calibration files

I am using `panda_EE` as the hand joint, since that should coincide (hopefully)
with the pose from `fa.get_pose()` in frankapy.

I collected v04 on 02/05/2023. I think it's OK, though the z-offset seems a bit
smaller than I'd expect. I collected those with the default Franka Desk App
values, so the "x offset" there is -0.01 (not -0.05 as I later set it for
experiments). I'm not sure if that affects things? The "v03" here is also from
that day, but has that offset, and the resulting x-transformation seems off by
about 3-4cm.

v05 on 02/10/2022 -- default Franka Desk App but seems strange.

v06 on 02/12/2022 -- I put the values in Franka Desk App that I need, and these
look better?

  x = -0.080 
    Not as much in abs value as earlier but x value for v05 was -0.070.
    FYI, v04 had -0.098. That's almost a 2cm difference!
  y = -0.028
    Seems OK? v05 was -0.039 but I think that's wrong.
  z = -0.031
    Seems OK? At least z is generally consistent.

Earlier the x value was around -0.090 reliably... maybe even close to -0.100...
Let's stick with v06 for now.

UPDATE:

Changing the calibration again on Feb 17 based on my evaluations of how it looks
when I do 5X of these. I think v05 could work.
